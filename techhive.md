My path to Pixar, and technology in general, was circuitous.

Attending UC Santa Cruz from 2000 to 2004, my interests were centered almost exclusively around the humanities. Russian history, journalism, political science, I spent my college years tucked safely in the redwoods, devouring the classics, totally unaware that I would end up working as a software engineer one day.
