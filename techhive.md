My path to Pixar, and technology in general, was circuitous.

### UC Santa Cruz

While attending UC Santa Cruz, my interests were centered almost exclusively around the humanities. Russian history, journalism, political science, education, I spent my college years tucked safely in the redwoods, devouring the classics, totally unaware that I would end up working as a software engineer one day. Wifi seemed as if it were cast from a magician's wand, my PC was a source of frustration more often than a source of productivity, and I'm pretty sure I had never seen the words "hello" and "world" written side by side.

### Peace Corps Ukraine

I graduated college eager to make an impact.

### Law Firm

I wanted to be a lawyer.

### SF City College

Much to my parents' dismay, I went community college instead of law school.

### Brown Bag Web Design

My first taste of an all night spent hacking.
