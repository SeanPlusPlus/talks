# My Technical Story

Hello! My name is Sean Stephenson and I am a software engineer in the Systems department at Pixar Animation Studios. Thank you so much for inviting me to attend this really cool event.

My path to Pixar, and technology in general, was circuitous.

I wasn't that iconic child taking apart the family toaster, and wiring it up to the Internet. I didn't code, and I wasn't a math wiz. Between school government and the newspaper, I'm pretty sure that anyone who knew me back in high school would have pegged me as a future politician or journalist.

### UC Santa Cruz

In college, while attending UC Santa Cruz, my interests were centered almost exclusively around the humanities and liberal arts. Russian history, journalism, political science, education, economics ... I spent my college years tucked safely in the redwoods, devouring the classics, totally unaware that I would end up working as a software engineer one day. Wifi seemed as if it were cast from a magician's wand, my PC was a source of frustration more often than a source of productivity, and I'm pretty sure I had never seen the words "hello" and "world" written side by side.


### Peace Corps Ukraine

I graduated college eager to make an impact, in search of adventure, and wanting to see more of the world. The Peace Corps seemed like a great opportunity to check all three of those boxes, so I signed up, and promptly shipped off. They placed me as an English teacher in Eastern Ukraine, and I spent over two years in a small village on the Russian border. Being from Southern California, winter had been a totally foreign concept to me.

Needless to say, my first winter in Ukraine was brutal. It was cold. No joke, it was extremely cold. I had to boil water in a tea kettle in order to wash my clothes by hand. I'd seal off the door to my bedroom, point my space heater to my little couch in the family room, and hunker down for several months.

But the opportunity to learn Russian, work with a phenomenal group of kids at our little school, and experience a life that was totally different from anything I'd ever lived, made it truly worth it.

Technology, like a warm southern California summer, was still very far away.

### Law Firm

After serving abroad for two years, I came back home, and decided that it was time to apply for law school. My big brother had just become a lawyer, and my parents were very keen on the idea of having both their children in the profession.

While applying I got a job as a case clerk at a law firm in downtown San Francisco. It was perfect. It was all part of the plan. Spend a year seeing the inside of a firm, learning about the machinations of law, and then head off to the green pastures of law school.

Then reality hit.

A typical task for me at the firm would go something like this: I'd be given five boxes of documents, each box full of printed out emails. And in each box, dozens of emails would be flagged with post-its. I'd have to pull those emails out, copy each twice, put them back in the box, and then sort out the copied sets into binders.

It was tedious. It was brutal.

A light bulb slowly started to brighten inside my head while going through these mountains of boxes of documents. I began to wonder what if a computer could do this? If all of these thousands of emails were written on computers, what if I could somehow get that data back in to some sort of application that could print them back out to me in whatever order I wanted.

And this is where my technical journey begins.

I started writing these tiny little scripts to organize scanned files and move them between Excel and a database. I'd stay hours after work banging my head on CSV files and parsing date ranges and file naming conventions. Over the course of a few weeks, technology came alive for me. By force of sheer will, I'd decided to no longer view software as magic from the magician's wand, but rather a system of rules that was totally understandable with sufficient work.

### SF City College

Just as I was beginning to obsess over this whole software thing, I was accepted into law school, and was now forced with making the biggest decision of my life.

My friends and family all assumed that I was going to be a lawyer. The inevitability of it was immense. But all I could think about was my next snippet of code to move files around.

So, in the Spring of 2007, I declined the law school acceptance letters, and enrolled in Intro to Computer Science at San Francisco City College. Everyone I knew was shocked. I think that my parents were even panicking a little bit.

My entire life trajectory seemed like it was going one way, and suddenly I'd made this dramatic life shift. But I couldn't help it, I was hooked. And getting my first opportunity to formally learn software development was one of the coolest experiences of my life.

I became singularly obsessed with becoming a software engineer. Not too sure what the job even really meant, I knew that I wanted to write code for a living, and I was going to work like mad to get there.

I spent the next three years, devouring CS classes at City College. Databases, Unix, C++, software engineering, literally anything technical I could get my hands on.

My best friend and I, with a lot of help from a friend who was a professional web developer, even started a web development business on the side. We would design sites for several local small businesses, getting paid hourly, or, if it were a cafe, we'd get paid in food.

### Pixar Systems

I was hired at Pixar in 2010, and the level of sheer joy I felt when getting the offer was unbelievable. Not only did I now have a chance to work at one of the most exciting companies in the Bay Area, but I somehow felt vindicated. Rolling the dice and not attending law school years before had felt like such a tremendous risk. But now, I'd made it. I was a Pixarian.

The first team I worked on was the Unix desktop administration team. It was a crash course in systems administration that really challenged me. Pixar runs on Linux machines - these massive desktop workstations with crazy amounts of cutting edge hardware - and keeping this system of computers up and running was a herculean task.

The first app I wrote at Pixar was called Heartbeat. Network problems would cause brutal fallout sometime with all of these massive Linux workstations. So we would have to print out lists of computers that had problems, and the corresponding office locations. It was gnarly. So I hacked together an app that took our office maps, and overlaid colors representing the states that the machines were in.

That app got me on the web dev team.
