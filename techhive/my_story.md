# My Technical Story

My path to Pixar, and technology in general, was circuitous. And on this journey I learned a valuable lesson: my past did not control my future.

I wasn't that iconic child taking apart the family toaster, and wiring it up to the Internet. I didn't code, and I wasn't a math wiz. Between school government and the newspaper, I'm pretty sure that anyone who knew me back in high school would have pegged me as a future politician or journalist.

### UC Santa Cruz

In college, while attending UC Santa Cruz, my interests were centered almost exclusively around the humanities and liberal arts. Russian history, journalism, political science, education, economics ... I spent my college years tucked safely in the redwoods, devouring the classics, totally unaware that I would end up working as a software engineer one day. Wifi seemed as if it were cast from a magician's wand, my PC was a source of frustration more often than a source of productivity, and I'm pretty sure I had never seen the words "hello" and "world" written side by side.


### Peace Corps Ukraine

I graduated college eager to make an impact, in search of adventure, and wanting to see more of the world. The Peace Corps seemed like a great opportunity to check all three of those boxes, so I signed up, and promptly shipped off.

They placed me as an English teacher in Eastern Ukraine, and I spent over two years in a small village on the Russian border. Being from Southern California, winter had been a totally foreign concept to me. Seriously, I don't think that I even owned a jacket growing up.

Needless to say, my first winter in Ukraine was brutal. It was cold. No joke, it was extremely cold. I had to boil water in a tea kettle in order to wash my clothes by hand. I'd seal off the door to my bedroom, point my space heater to my little couch in the family room, and hunker down for several months.

But the opportunity to learn Russian, work with a phenomenal group of kids at our little school, and experience a life that was totally different from anything I'd ever lived, made it truly worth it.

### Law Firm

After serving abroad for two years, I came back home, and decided that it was time to apply for law school. My big brother had just become a lawyer, and my parents were very keen on the idea of having both their children in the profession.

While applying I got a job as a case clerk at a law firm in downtown San Francisco. It was perfect. It was all part of the plan. Spend a year seeing the inside of a firm, learning about the machinations of law, and then head off to the green pastures of law school.


### SF City College

Much to my parents' dismay, instead of going to law school, I signed up for computer science at San Francisco City College.


### Brown Bag Web Design

My first taste of an all night spent hacking.

Eastwood Development, John Campbell's ...

I was interviewing like crazy, hungry to get a job at a tech company, and see if this really was the right choice for me.
